        "text": "A galaxy is a system of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), [stellar [remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_remnant), [interstellar gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium), [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust), and [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) bound together by [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity). The word is derived from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) galaxias (\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1\u03c2), literally 'milky', a reference to the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy that contains the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:[Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Astronomy)):Solar_System). [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies), averaging an estimated 100 million [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), range in size from [dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy) with less than a thousand [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), to the [[largest galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_galaxies) known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_galaxies) \u2013 [supergiants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-cD_galaxy) with one hundred [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%5E12) [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), each orbiting its galaxy's [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass). Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter), with [only a few](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxies#Named_galaxies) percent of that mass visible in the form of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) and [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula). [Supermassive [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) are a common feature at the centres of galaxies. [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies) are categorised according to their visual [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(astronomy)) as [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_elliptical_galaxy), [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy), or [irregular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy#Common_dwarf_galaxy_types). The [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) is an example of a [[spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy). It is estimated that there are between 200 billion (2\u00d71011) to 2 [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%5E12) galaxies in the [observable [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe). Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 [light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year)) and are separated by distances in the order of millions of [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) (or [megaparsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Megaparsecs_and_gigaparsecs)). For comparison, the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) has a diameter of at least 26,800 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) (87,400 [ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year)) and is separated from the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), its nearest large neighbour, by just over 750,000 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) (2.5 million [ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year)). The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the [intergalactic medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergalactic_space)) with an average density of less than one [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom) per cubic metre. Most galaxies are gravitationally organised into [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group), [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) and [superclusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercluster). The [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) is part of the [Local Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group), which it dominates along with the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy). The [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group) is part of the [Virgo Supercluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster). At the [largest scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_Cosmos), these associations are generally arranged into [sheets and filaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_filament) surrounded by immense [voids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy)). Both the [Local Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group) and the [Virgo Supercluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster) are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named [Laniakea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster).",

                "text": "The word galaxy was borrowed via [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) and [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin) from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) term for the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), galax\u00edas (k\u00faklos) \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) 'milky (circle)', named after its appearance as a milky band of light in the sky. In [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) mythology, [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus) places his son, born by a mortal woman, the infant [Heracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles), on [Hera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera)'s breast while she is asleep so the baby will drink [her divine milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_of_Hera) and thus become immortal. [Hera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera) wakes up while breastfeeding and then realises she is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills, and it produces the band of light known as the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way). In the astronomical literature, the capitalised word \"Galaxy\" is often used to refer to the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy, to distinguish it from the other galaxies in the [observable [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe). The English term [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) can be traced back to a story by [Geoffrey Chaucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer) c.\u20091380:  See yonder, lo, the Galaxy\u00eb Which men clepeth the Milky Wey, For hit is whyt. [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies) were initially discovered telescopically and were known as [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula). Most 18th- to 19th-century astronomers considered them as either unresolved star [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) or anagalactic [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula), and were just thought of as a part of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), but their true composition and natures remained a mystery. Observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies, like the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), began resolving them into huge conglomerations of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), but based simply on the apparent faintness and sheer population of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), the true distances of these objects placed them well beyond the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way). For this reason they were popularly called island universes, but this term quickly fell into disuse, as the word [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) implied the entirety of existence. Instead, they became known simply as galaxies.",

Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the [Messier catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_catalogue), the NGC ([New General Catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_General_Catalogue)), the IC ([Index Catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Catalogue)), the CGCG ([Catalogue of [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies) and of Clusters of [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Galaxies_and_of_Clusters_of_Galaxies)), the MCG ([Morphological Catalogue of [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_Catalogue_of_Galaxies)), the UGC ([Uppsala General Catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_General_Catalogue) of [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)), and the PGC ([Catalogue of Principal [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Principal_Galaxies), also known as LEDA). All the well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different number. For example, [Messier 109](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_109) (or \"M109\") is a [[spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) having the number 109 in the catalogue of Messier.  It also has the designations NGC 3992, UGC 6937, CGCG 269\u2013023, MCG +09-20-044, and PGC 37617 (or LEDA 37617), among others.  Millions of fainter galaxies are known by their identifiers in [sky surveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_surveys) such as the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey).",

                        "text": "[Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) philosopher [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus) (450\u2013370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) might consist of distant [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star). [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (384\u2013322 BCE), however, believed the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) was caused by \"the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) that were large, numerous and close together\" and that the \"ignition takes place in the upper part of the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere), in the [region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary_sphere).\" [Neoplatonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism) philosopher [Olympiodorus the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiodorus_the_Younger) (c.\u2009495\u2013570 CE) was critical of this view, arguing that if the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) was [sublunary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary) (situated between Earth and the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon)) it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), which it did not. In his view, the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) was celestial. According to Mohani Mohamed, [Arabian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world) astronomer [Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham) (965\u20131037) made the first attempt at observing and measuring the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way)'s [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), and he thus \"determined that because the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) had no [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), it must be remote from the Earth, not belonging to the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere).\" [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people) astronomer [al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni) (973\u20131048) proposed the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy was \"a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star).\" [Andalusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus) astronomer [Avempace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avempace) (d. 1138) proposed that it was composed of many [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) that almost touched one another, and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction) from [sublunary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary) material, citing his observation of the [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy_and_astrology)) of Jupiter and Mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects were near. In the 14th century, Syrian-born [Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Qayyim_al-Jawziyya) proposed the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy was \"a myriad of tiny [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) packed together in the sphere of the fixed [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star).\"  Actual proof of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) consisting of many [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) used a [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_telescope) to study it and discovered it was composed of a huge number of faint [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star). In 1750, English astronomer [Thomas Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wright_(astronomer)), in his An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe, correctly speculated that it might be a rotating body of a huge number of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) held together by [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation) forces, akin to the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:[Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Astronomy)):Solar_System) but on a much larger scale, and that the resulting disk of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) could be seen as a band on the sky from a perspective inside it. In his 1755 treatise, [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) elaborated on Wright's idea about the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way)'s structure.  The first project to describe the shape of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) and the position of the Sun was undertaken by [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel) in 1785 by counting the number of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:[Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Astronomy)):Solar_System) close to the center. Using a refined approach, [Kapteyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Kapteyn) in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15 [kiloparsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Parsecs_and_kiloparsecs)) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley) based on the cataloguing of globular [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70 [kiloparsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Parsecs_and_kiloparsecs) and the Sun far from the centre. Both analyses failed to take into account the [absorption of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(astronomy)) by interstellar [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) present in the [galactic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_plane); but after [Robert Julius Trumpler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Julius_Trumpler) quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies), the present picture of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy emerged.",

In the 10th century, [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people) astronomer [Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Rahman_al-Sufi) made the earliest recorded identification of the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), describing it as a \"small cloud\". In 964, he probably mentioned the [Large [Magellanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_spiral) Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud) in his [Book of Fixed [Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Stars)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Fixed_Stars), referring to \"Al Bakr of the southern Arabs\", since at a [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination) of about 70\u00b0 south it was not visible where he lived. It was not well known to Europeans until [Magellan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan)'s voyage in the 16th century. The [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) was later independently noted by [Simon Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Marius) in 1612. In 1734, philosopher [Emanuel Swedenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg) in his Principia speculated that there might be other galaxies outside that were formed into galactic [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) that were minuscule parts of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) that extended far beyond what could be seen. These views \"are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos.\" In 1745, [Pierre Louis Maupertuis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis) conjectured that some [nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula)-like objects were collections of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) with unique properties, including a [glow exceeding the light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jets) its [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) produced on their own, and repeated [Johannes Hevelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius)'s view that the bright spots were massive and flattened due to their rotation. In 1750, [Thomas Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wright_(astronomer)) correctly speculated that the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) was a flattened disk of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), and that some of the [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) visible in the night sky might be separate Milky Ways.  Toward the end of the 18th century, [Charles Messier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier) compiled a [catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel) assembled a [catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) of 5,000 [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula). In 1845, [Lord Rosse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parsons,_3rd_Earl_of_Rosse) examined the [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) catalogued by Herschel and observed the [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) structure of [[Messier object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) M51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy), now known as the [Whirlpool Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy). In 1912, [Vesto M. Slipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_M._Slipher) made spectrographic studies of the brightest [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) have high [Doppler shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_shift), indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) he had measured. He found that the majority of these [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) are moving away from us. In 1917, [Heber Doust Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis) observed nova [S Andromedae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_Andromedae) within the \"Great [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Nebula\", as the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), [Messier object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) [M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), was then known. Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more [novae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova). Curtis noticed that these [novae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova) were, on average, 10 [magnitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)) fainter than those that occurred within this galaxy. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec). He became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which holds that [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) are actually independent galaxies. In 1920 a debate took place between [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley) and [Heber Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Curtis), the [Great Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)), concerning the nature of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula), and the dimensions of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe). To support his claim that the Great [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of [dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) lanes resembling the [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) clouds in the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), as well as the significant Doppler shift. In 1922, the [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia) astronomer [Ernst \u00d6pik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_%C3%96pik) gave a distance determination that supported the theory that the [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100-inch [Mt. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory) [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_telescope), [Edwin [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble) was able to resolve the outer parts of some [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) as collections of individual [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) and identified some [Cepheid variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable), thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula): they were far too distant to be part of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way). In 1926 [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) produced a classification of galactic [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(astronomy)) that is used to this day.",

After centuries of success in [optical astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_astronomy), recent decades have seen major progress in other regions of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum). The [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) present in the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium) is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to [far-[infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_infrared_astronomy), which can be used to observe the interior regions of giant [molecular clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud) and [galactic cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_(astronomy)) in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, [red-shifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) galaxies that were formed much earlier. Water vapor and [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) absorb a number of useful portions of the [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for [[infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_astronomy). The first non-visual study of galaxies, particularly [active galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galaxy), was made using [radio frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy). The Earth's [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) is nearly transparent to radio between 5 [MHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) and 30 GHz. The [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere) blocks signals below this range.

The distribution of hot gas in galactic [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.",

This radiation is not affected by [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) absorption, and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in this galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating [bar structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy) in the center of this galaxy. With improved [radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) gas could also be traced in other galaxies. In the 1970s, [Vera Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin) uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic [rotation speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve) and that predicted by the visible mass of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) and gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem is thought to be explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter). Beginning in the 1990s, the [[Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) yielded improved observations. Among other things, its data helped establish that the missing [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) in this galaxy could not consist solely of inherently faint and small [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star). The [[Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) Deep [Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_galaxy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field), an extremely long exposure of a relatively empty part of the sky, provided evidence that there are about 125 billion (1.25\u00d71011) galaxies in the [observable [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe). Improved technology in detecting the [spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) invisible to humans ([radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope), [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) cameras, and [x-ray telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_astronomy)) allows detection of other galaxies that are not detected by [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope). Particularly, surveys in the [Zone of Avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_Avoidance) (the region of sky blocked at visible-light wavelengths by the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way)) have revealed a number of new galaxies. A 2016 study published in [The Astrophysical Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astrophysical_Journal), led by [Christopher Conselice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Conselice) of the [University of Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham), used 20 years of [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) images to estimate that the [observable [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) contained at least two [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%5E12) (2\u00d71012) galaxies. However, later observations with the [New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons) space probe from outside the [zodiacal light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light) reduced this to roughly 200 billion (2\u00d71011).",

They are popularly known as the supergiant [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_elliptical_galaxy) galaxies and constitute the largest and most luminous galaxies known.

Many [barred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_irregular_galaxy) [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms. Our own galaxy, the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), is a large disk-shaped [barred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_irregular_galaxy)-[[spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) about 30 [kiloparsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Parsecs_and_kiloparsecs) in diameter and a kiloparsec thick. It contains about two hundred billion (2\u00d71011) [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) and has a total mass of about six hundred billion (6\u00d71011) times the mass of the Sun.",

A [ring galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_galaxy) has a ring-like structure of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) and [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium) surrounding a bare core. A [ring galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_galaxy) is thought to occur when a smaller galaxy passes through the core of a [[spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy). Such an event may have affected the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), as it displays a multi-ring-like structure when viewed in [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) radiation. A [lenticular galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_galaxy) is an [intermediate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_spiral_galaxy) form that has properties of both [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_elliptical_galaxy) and [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxies. These are categorized as [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) type S0, and they possess ill-defined [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) arms with an [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_elliptical_galaxy) halo of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) ([[barred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_irregular_galaxy) lenticular galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_lenticular_galaxy) receive [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) classification SB0). [[Irregular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_galaxy) galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_galaxy) are galaxies that can not be readily classified into an [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_elliptical_galaxy) or [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(astronomy)). An Irr-I galaxy has some structure but does not align cleanly with the [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) classification scheme. Irr-II galaxies do not possess any structure that resembles a [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) classification, and may have been disrupted. Nearby examples of (dwarf) [irregular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy#Common_dwarf_galaxy_types) galaxies include the [[Magellanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_spiral) Clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds). A [dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) or \"ultra diffuse\" galaxy is an extremely-low-luminosity galaxy. It may be the same size as the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), but have a visible star count only one percent of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way)'s. Multiple mechanisms for producing this type of galaxy have been proposed, and it is possible that different [dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) galaxies formed by different means. One candidate explanation for the low luminosity is that the galaxy lost its star-forming gas at an early stage, resulting in old stellar populations.",
