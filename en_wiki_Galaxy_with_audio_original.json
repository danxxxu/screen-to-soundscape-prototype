        "text": "A galaxy is a system of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), [stellar [remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_remnant), [interstellar gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium), [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust), and [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) bound together by [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity). The word is derived from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) galaxias (\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1\u03c2), literally 'milky', a reference to the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy that contains the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:[Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Astronomy)):Solar_System). [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies), averaging an estimated 100 million [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), range in size from [dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy) with less than a thousand [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), to the [[largest galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_galaxies) known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_galaxies) \u2013 [supergiants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-cD_galaxy) with one hundred [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%5E12) [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), each orbiting its galaxy's [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass). Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter), with [only a few](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxies#Named_galaxies) percent of that mass visible in the form of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) and [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula). [Supermassive [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) are a common feature at the centres of galaxies. [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies) are categorised according to their visual [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(astronomy)) as [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_elliptical_galaxy), [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy), or [irregular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy#Common_dwarf_galaxy_types). The [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) is an example of a [[spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy). It is estimated that there are between 200 billion (2\u00d71011) to 2 [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%5E12) galaxies in the [observable [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe). Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 [light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year)) and are separated by distances in the order of millions of [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) (or [megaparsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Megaparsecs_and_gigaparsecs)). For comparison, the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) has a diameter of at least 26,800 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) (87,400 [ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year)) and is separated from the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), its nearest large neighbour, by just over 750,000 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) (2.5 million [ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year)). The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the [intergalactic medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergalactic_space)) with an average density of less than one [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom) per cubic metre. Most galaxies are gravitationally organised into [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group), [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) and [superclusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercluster). The [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) is part of the [Local Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group), which it dominates along with the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy). The [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group) is part of the [Virgo Supercluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster). At the [largest scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_Cosmos), these associations are generally arranged into [sheets and filaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_filament) surrounded by immense [voids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy)). Both the [Local Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group) and the [Virgo Supercluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster) are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named [Laniakea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster).",

                "text": "The word galaxy was borrowed via [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) and [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin) from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) term for the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), galax\u00edas (k\u00faklos) \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) 'milky (circle)', named after its appearance as a milky band of light in the sky. In [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) mythology, [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus) places his son, born by a mortal woman, the infant [Heracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles), on [Hera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera)'s breast while she is asleep so the baby will drink [her divine milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_of_Hera) and thus become immortal. [Hera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera) wakes up while breastfeeding and then realises she is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills, and it produces the band of light known as the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way). In the astronomical literature, the capitalised word \"Galaxy\" is often used to refer to the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy, to distinguish it from the other galaxies in the [observable [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe). The English term [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) can be traced back to a story by [Geoffrey Chaucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer) c.\u20091380:  See yonder, lo, the Galaxy\u00eb Which men clepeth the Milky Wey, For hit is whyt. [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies) were initially discovered telescopically and were known as [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula). Most 18th- to 19th-century astronomers considered them as either unresolved star [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) or anagalactic [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula), and were just thought of as a part of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), but their true composition and natures remained a mystery. Observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies, like the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), began resolving them into huge conglomerations of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), but based simply on the apparent faintness and sheer population of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), the true distances of these objects placed them well beyond the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way). For this reason they were popularly called island universes, but this term quickly fell into disuse, as the word [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) implied the entirety of existence. Instead, they became known simply as galaxies.",

Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the [Messier catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_catalogue), the NGC ([New General Catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_General_Catalogue)), the IC ([Index Catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Catalogue)), the CGCG ([Catalogue of [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies) and of Clusters of [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Galaxies_and_of_Clusters_of_Galaxies)), the MCG ([Morphological Catalogue of [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_Catalogue_of_Galaxies)), the UGC ([Uppsala General Catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_General_Catalogue) of [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)), and the PGC ([Catalogue of Principal [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Principal_Galaxies), also known as LEDA). All the well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different number. For example, [Messier 109](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_109) (or \"M109\") is a [[spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) having the number 109 in the catalogue of Messier.  It also has the designations NGC 3992, UGC 6937, CGCG 269\u2013023, MCG +09-20-044, and PGC 37617 (or LEDA 37617), among others.  Millions of fainter galaxies are known by their identifiers in [sky surveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_surveys) such as the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey).",

                        "text": "[Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) philosopher [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus) (450\u2013370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) might consist of distant [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star). [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (384\u2013322 BCE), however, believed the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) was caused by \"the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) that were large, numerous and close together\" and that the \"ignition takes place in the upper part of the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere), in the [region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary_sphere).\" [Neoplatonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism) philosopher [Olympiodorus the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiodorus_the_Younger) (c.\u2009495\u2013570 CE) was critical of this view, arguing that if the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) was [sublunary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary) (situated between Earth and the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon)) it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), which it did not. In his view, the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) was celestial. According to Mohani Mohamed, [Arabian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world) astronomer [Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham) (965\u20131037) made the first attempt at observing and measuring the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way)'s [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), and he thus \"determined that because the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) had no [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), it must be remote from the Earth, not belonging to the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere).\" [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people) astronomer [al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni) (973\u20131048) proposed the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy was \"a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star).\" [Andalusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus) astronomer [Avempace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avempace) (d. 1138) proposed that it was composed of many [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) that almost touched one another, and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction) from [sublunary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary) material, citing his observation of the [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy_and_astrology)) of Jupiter and Mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects were near. In the 14th century, Syrian-born [Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Qayyim_al-Jawziyya) proposed the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy was \"a myriad of tiny [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) packed together in the sphere of the fixed [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star).\"  Actual proof of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) consisting of many [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) used a [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_telescope) to study it and discovered it was composed of a huge number of faint [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star). In 1750, English astronomer [Thomas Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wright_(astronomer)), in his An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe, correctly speculated that it might be a rotating body of a huge number of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) held together by [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation) forces, akin to the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:[Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Astronomy)):Solar_System) but on a much larger scale, and that the resulting disk of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) could be seen as a band on the sky from a perspective inside it. In his 1755 treatise, [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) elaborated on Wright's idea about the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way)'s structure.  The first project to describe the shape of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) and the position of the Sun was undertaken by [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel) in 1785 by counting the number of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:[Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Astronomy)):Solar_System) close to the center. Using a refined approach, [Kapteyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Kapteyn) in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15 [kiloparsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Parsecs_and_kiloparsecs)) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley) based on the cataloguing of globular [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70 [kiloparsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Parsecs_and_kiloparsecs) and the Sun far from the centre. Both analyses failed to take into account the [absorption of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(astronomy)) by interstellar [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) present in the [galactic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_plane); but after [Robert Julius Trumpler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Julius_Trumpler) quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies), the present picture of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy emerged.",

In the 10th century, [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people) astronomer [Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Rahman_al-Sufi) made the earliest recorded identification of the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), describing it as a \"small cloud\". In 964, he probably mentioned the [Large [Magellanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_spiral) Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud) in his [Book of Fixed [Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Stars)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Fixed_Stars), referring to \"Al Bakr of the southern Arabs\", since at a [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination) of about 70\u00b0 south it was not visible where he lived. It was not well known to Europeans until [Magellan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan)'s voyage in the 16th century. The [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) was later independently noted by [Simon Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Marius) in 1612. In 1734, philosopher [Emanuel Swedenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg) in his Principia speculated that there might be other galaxies outside that were formed into galactic [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) that were minuscule parts of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) that extended far beyond what could be seen. These views \"are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos.\" In 1745, [Pierre Louis Maupertuis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis) conjectured that some [nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula)-like objects were collections of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) with unique properties, including a [glow exceeding the light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jets) its [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) produced on their own, and repeated [Johannes Hevelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius)'s view that the bright spots were massive and flattened due to their rotation. In 1750, [Thomas Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wright_(astronomer)) correctly speculated that the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) was a flattened disk of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), and that some of the [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) visible in the night sky might be separate Milky Ways.  Toward the end of the 18th century, [Charles Messier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier) compiled a [catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel) assembled a [catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) of 5,000 [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula). In 1845, [Lord Rosse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parsons,_3rd_Earl_of_Rosse) examined the [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) catalogued by Herschel and observed the [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) structure of [[Messier object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) M51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy), now known as the [Whirlpool Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy). In 1912, [Vesto M. Slipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_M._Slipher) made spectrographic studies of the brightest [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) have high [Doppler shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_shift), indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) he had measured. He found that the majority of these [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) are moving away from us. In 1917, [Heber Doust Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Doust_Curtis) observed nova [S Andromedae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_Andromedae) within the \"Great [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Nebula\", as the [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), [Messier object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) [M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), was then known. Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more [novae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova). Curtis noticed that these [novae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova) were, on average, 10 [magnitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)) fainter than those that occurred within this galaxy. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec). He became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which holds that [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) are actually independent galaxies. In 1920 a debate took place between [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley) and [Heber Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heber_Curtis), the [Great Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)), concerning the nature of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula), and the dimensions of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe). To support his claim that the Great [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of [dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) lanes resembling the [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) clouds in the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), as well as the significant Doppler shift. In 1922, the [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia) astronomer [Ernst \u00d6pik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_%C3%96pik) gave a distance determination that supported the theory that the [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100-inch [Mt. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory) [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_telescope), [Edwin [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble) was able to resolve the outer parts of some [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) as collections of individual [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) and identified some [Cepheid variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable), thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula): they were far too distant to be part of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way). In 1926 [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) produced a classification of galactic [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(astronomy)) that is used to this day.",

After centuries of success in [optical astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_astronomy), recent decades have seen major progress in other regions of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum). The [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) present in the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium) is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to [far-[infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_infrared_astronomy), which can be used to observe the interior regions of giant [molecular clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud) and [galactic cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_(astronomy)) in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, [red-shifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) galaxies that were formed much earlier. Water vapor and [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) absorb a number of useful portions of the [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for [[infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_astronomy). The first non-visual study of galaxies, particularly [active galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galaxy), was made using [radio frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy). The Earth's [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) is nearly transparent to radio between 5 [MHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) and 30 GHz. The [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere) blocks signals below this range.

The distribution of hot gas in galactic [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies) can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.",

This radiation is not affected by [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) absorption, and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in this galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating [bar structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy) in the center of this galaxy. With improved [radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) gas could also be traced in other galaxies. In the 1970s, [Vera Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin) uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic [rotation speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve) and that predicted by the visible mass of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) and gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem is thought to be explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter). Beginning in the 1990s, the [[Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) yielded improved observations. Among other things, its data helped establish that the missing [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) in this galaxy could not consist solely of inherently faint and small [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star). The [[Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) Deep [Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_galaxy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field), an extremely long exposure of a relatively empty part of the sky, provided evidence that there are about 125 billion (1.25\u00d71011) galaxies in the [observable [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe). Improved technology in detecting the [spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) invisible to humans ([radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope), [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) cameras, and [x-ray telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_astronomy)) allows detection of other galaxies that are not detected by [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope). Particularly, surveys in the [Zone of Avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_Avoidance) (the region of sky blocked at visible-light wavelengths by the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way)) have revealed a number of new galaxies. A 2016 study published in [The Astrophysical Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astrophysical_Journal), led by [Christopher Conselice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Conselice) of the [University of Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham), used 20 years of [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) images to estimate that the [observable [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) contained at least two [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%5E12) (2\u00d71012) galaxies. However, later observations with the [New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons) space probe from outside the [zodiacal light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light) reduced this to roughly 200 billion (2\u00d71011).",

They are popularly known as the supergiant [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_elliptical_galaxy) galaxies and constitute the largest and most luminous galaxies known.

This is the radius upon which half, or 50%, of the total brightness flux of the galaxy was emitted. This was first proposed by [G\u00e9rard de Vaucouleurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_de_Vaucouleurs) in 1948. The choice of using 50% was arbitrary, but proved to be useful in further works by R. A.

In defining Re, it is necessary that the overall brightness flux galaxy should be captured, with a method employed by Bershady in 2000 suggesting to measure twice the size where the brightness flux of an arbitrarily chosen radius, defined as the local flux, divided by the overall average flux equals to 0.2.

This method employs a mathematical model on a galaxy whose radius is determined by the azimuthally (horizontal) averaged profile of its brightness flux. In particular, the SDSS employed the Petrosian magnitude in the R-band (658 nm, in the red part of the visible spectrum) to ensure that the brightness flux of a galaxy would be captured as much as possible while counteracting the effects of background noise. For a galaxy whose brightness profile is exponential, it is expected to capture all of its brightness flux, and 80% for galaxies that follow a profile that follows [de Vaucouleurs's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Vaucouleurs%27s_law). Petrosian [magnitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)) have the advantage of being redshift and distance independent, allowing the measurement of the galaxy's apparent size since the Petrosian radius is defined in terms of the galaxy's overall luminous flux. A critique of an earlier version of this method has been issued by the [Infrared Processing and Analysis Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_Processing_and_Analysis_Center), with the method causing a magnitude of error (upwards to 10%) of the values than using isophotal diameter.

Solitary galaxies that have not significantly interacted with other galaxies of comparable mass in the past few billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed are isolated in this sense. However, they may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller satellite galaxies. On the [largest scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_Cosmos), the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) is continually expanding, resulting in an average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope)'s law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation) attraction. These associations formed early, as clumps of [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group) later merged to form larger-scale [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies).

About 70\u201380% of a [cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster)'s mass is in the form of [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter), with 10\u201330% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent in the form of galaxies. Most galaxies are gravitationally bound to a number of other galaxies. These form a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)-like hierarchical distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group). A [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group) of galaxies is the most common type of galactic [cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster); these formations contain the majority of galaxies (as well as most of the [baryonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon) mass) in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe). To remain gravitationally bound to such a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group), each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see [Virial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_theorem)). If there is insufficient [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy), however, the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group) may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.

The strongest total [equipartition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem) fields (50\u2013100 \u03bcG) were found in [[starburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starburst_(astronomy)) galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starburst_galaxy)\u2014for example, in M 82 and the [Antennae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antennae_Galaxies); and in nuclear [starburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starburst_(astronomy)) regions, such as the centers of NGC 1097 and other [[barred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_irregular_galaxy) galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy).",

                        "text": "Current models of the [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation) of galaxies in the early [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) are based on the [\u039bCDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) model. About 300,000 years after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang), atoms of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) and [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium) began to form, in an event called [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)). Nearly all the [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) was neutral (non-[ionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion)) and readily absorbed light, and no [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) had yet formed. As a result, this period has been called the \"[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) ages\". It was from density fluctuations (or [anisotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy) irregularities) in this primordial matter that [larger structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_formation) began to appear. As a result, masses of [baryonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon) matter started to condense within cold [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) halos. These primordial structures allowed gasses to condense in to [protogalaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Protogalaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protogalaxy)), large scale gas clouds that were precursors to the first galaxies.:\u200a6\u200a As gas falls in to the [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity) of the [[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy) matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) halos, its pressure and temperature rise. To condense further, the gas must radiate energy. This process was slow in the early [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) dominated by [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) atoms and molecules which are inefficient radiators compared to heavier elements. As clumps of gas aggregate forming rotating disks, temperatures and pressures continue to increase. Some places within the disk reach high enough density to form [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star).  Once [protogalaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Protogalaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protogalaxy)) began to form and contract, the first halo [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), called Population III [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), appeared within them. These were composed of primordial gas, almost entirely of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) and [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium). Emission from the first [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) heats the remaining gas helping to trigger additional [star [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation); the ultraviolet light emission from the first generation of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) re-[ionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion) the surrounding neutral [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) in expanding spheres eventually reaching the entire [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe), an event called [reionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization). The most massive [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) collapse in violent [supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova) explosions releasing heavy elements (\"metals\") into the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium).:\u200a14\u200a This metal content is incorporated into population II [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star). Theoretical models for early galaxy [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation) have been verified and informed by a large number and variety of sophisticated astronomical observations.:\u200a43\u200a The photometric observations generally need spectroscopic confirmation due the large number mechanisms that can introduce systematic errors. For example, a high redshift (z ~ 16) photometric observation by [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope) (JWST) was later corrected to be closer to z ~ 5. Nevertheless, confirmed observations from the JWST and other observatories are accumulating, allowing systematic comparison of early galaxies to predictions of theory. Evidence for individual Population III [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) in early galaxies is even more challenging. Even seemingly confirmed spectroscopic evidence may turn out to have other origins. For example, astronomers reported HeII emission evidence for Population III [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) in the [Cosmos Redshift 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos_Redshift_7) galaxy, with a redshift value of 6.60. Subsequent observations found metallic emission lines, OIII, inconsistent with an early-galaxy star.:\u200a108",

                        "text": "Once [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) begin to form, emit radiation, and in some cases explode, the process of galaxy [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation) becomes very complex, involving interactions between the forces of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity), radiation, and thermal energy. Many details are still poorly understood. Within a billion years of a galaxy's [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation), key structures begin to appear. Globular [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusters_of_galaxies), the central [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole), and a galactic [bulge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_(astronomy)) of metal-poor Population II [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) form. The creation of a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) appears to play a key role in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added. During this early epoch, galaxies undergo a major burst of [star [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation). During the following two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into a [galactic disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_(galaxy)). A galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material from [high-velocity clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-velocity_cloud) and [dwarf galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy) throughout its life. This matter is mostly [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) and [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium). The cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation) of [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet).  Star [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation) rates in galaxies depend upon their local environment. Isolated 'void' galaxies have highest rate per stellar mass, with 'field' galaxies associated with [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) galaxies having lower rates and galaxies in dense [cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster) having the lowest rates. The evolution of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common during the early epoch, and the majority of galaxies were peculiar in [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(astronomy)). Given the distances between the [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star), the great majority of stellar [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system) in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation) stripping of the [interstellar gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium) and [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) that makes up the [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spiral_galaxy) arms produces a long train of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in [NGC 4676](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4676) or the [[Antennae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antennae_Galaxies) [Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Galaxies):Galaxies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antennae_Galaxies). The [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) galaxy and the nearby [[Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) are moving toward each other at about 130 [km/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second), and\u2014depending upon the lateral movements\u2014the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) has never collided with a galaxy as large as [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) before, it has collided and merged with other galaxies in the past. Cosmological simulations indicate that, 11 billion years ago, it merged with a particularly large galaxy that has been labeled the [Kraken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_galaxy). Such large-scale interactions are rare. As time passes, mergers of two [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system) of equal size become less common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged for the last few billion years, and the net rate of [star [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_formation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation) probably also peaked about ten billion years ago.",
